A closet organization web app that lets you upload and manage your clothes/outfits digitally.

## Features (ConUHacks X)

For the 24 hour hackathon, I built a simple closet organization web app with the following features:

- **Digital Closet Management**: Store and organize clothing items with automated tagging (color, category) powered by Gemini AI
- **Image processing**: Images of clothes have their backgrounds stripped to provide a cleaner look and feel when browsing your closet
- **Closet Analytics**: View statistics about your wardrobe
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Get daily outfit suggestions based on your style
- **Smart Search**: Find clothes by color, category, or "vibe" (e.g., fashion trends, abstract descriptions)
- **Social Sharing**: Generate shareable links to specific clothing items
